# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - My First Machine Learning Project

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using classic machine learning techniques. It was built as a beginner-friendly introduction to data science and model building using Python.

## 📌 What This Project Covers

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing
- 🔢 Feature engineering & scaling
- 🤖 Logistic Regression model
- ✅ Evaluation using accuracy, classification report, ROC curve
- 🧪 Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- 🔮 Making predictions for new passengers

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Dataset

- Dataset used: Titanic dataset from [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data)  
- Target: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 💡 How the Model Works

1. Clean the dataset (remove irrelevant columns, fill missing values)
2. Convert text columns to numbers
3. Scale numeric features
4. Train a logistic regression model
5. Evaluate model performance (Accuracy ~81%, AUC ~0.88)
6. Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV
7. Predict survival for a new sample passenger
